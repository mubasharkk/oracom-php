# Living in Berlin: Diversity, Freedom, and Contrast

Berlin is Germany’s capital and one of Europe’s most diverse cities. Living in Berlin means embracing contrasts between history, creativity, and modern life.

The city is highly international, with English widely spoken. Housing is competitive, but costs remain lower than many European capitals.

Each neighborhood has its own character, from family-friendly areas to creative and vibrant districts.

Berlin offers strong public transport, cultural life, and startup opportunities, especially in tech and creative industries.

Despite its openness, bureaucracy still requires patience.

Berlin attracts people who value freedom, diversity, and individuality.
